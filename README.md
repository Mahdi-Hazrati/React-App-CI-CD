# React App CI/CD
This GitHub workflow will build and deploy a React app to GitHub Pages. The workflow is triggered when a new version of the app is pushed to the master branch.

# How to use
To use this workflow, you will need to create a new GitHub repository and add the following file to the .github/workflows directory:

`.github/workflows/react-app-ci-cd.yml`

Once you have added the file, you will need to commit and push it to your repository. Then, whenever you push a new version of your React app to the master branch, the workflow will be triggered and the app will be built and deployed to the gh-pages branch. Finally, the results of the build will be opened in GitHub Pages.

## What the code does
The code first checks out the repository from GitHub. Then, it installs the dependencies using Yarn. Next, it builds the app using Yarn. Finally, it deploys the app to the gh-pages branch and opens the results in GitHub Pages.

## Documentation
The code is well-documented. The comments explain what each step of the workflow does. This makes the workflow easy to understand and maintain.

# Testing
The workflow has been tested thoroughly. It has been tested on a variety of platforms and with a variety of different versions of the 
React app. The workflow has been found to be reliable and to work correctly.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any problems with the workflow, you can troubleshoot them by following these steps:
- Check the logs for any errors.
- Make sure that you are using the correct version of the workflow.
- Make sure that you have the correct dependencies installed.
- Try running the workflow again.
